# Control_Magneti_Levitation_System
Stabilization and Tracking Control of The Magnetic Levitation System for Robotic Motion using PID Controllers in MATLAB SIMULINK.

MLS is known as electromechanical systems in which an object floats in a specific area without the use of any support. This technology is being widely developed due to the frictionlessness of the system; because it eliminates energy losses due to friction. This technology has been used in various fields such as precision positioning systems, engines, vehicles with magnetic force and wind turbines, micro-robots and biomedical devices.

In this project, we examined the controller design methods by positioning the poles with the help of state feedback and examining different observers.
